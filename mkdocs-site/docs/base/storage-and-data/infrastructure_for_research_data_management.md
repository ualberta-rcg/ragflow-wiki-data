This page has been specially written to provide users with a detailed and accessible reference on how to optimize the management of their research data in our cloud environment.

Whether you're a researcher, scientist, student, or professional working with research data, this guide aims to make your experience easier by providing clear information and practical advice.

Browse the different sections dedicated to data security, real-time collaboration, analytics integration, and much more. Whether you're using our platform for the first time, or are an experienced user looking to deepen your knowledge, this guide is designed to meet your needs, step by step.

# Navigation and Configuration

Before we dive into the details, let's take a moment to explore the fundamentals that will help you navigate and configure your cloud platform experience.

## Environment Discovery

We supply one aggregate per research team's primary investigator.

This aggregate includes 4 virtual machines (1 for application containers and 3 for the database aggregate) using standard Ubuntu 22.04 LTS images.

Research Teams can use:

*   **OpenID Hub**: for authentication and authorization
*   **Mattermost**: for group messaging
*   **Nextcloud**: for file sharing and synchronization

Each application is accessible from a sub-domain dedicated to the research team:

*   **OpenID Hub** on *research_team_name*.idp.cirst.ca
*   **Mattermost** on *research_team_name*.chat.cirst.ca
*   **Nextcloud** on *research_team_name*.cloud.cirst.ca

!!! note
    *research_team_name* must be replaced by the name of the research team selected during enrolment.

# Identity and Authentication

This crucial part of our guide highlights the identity provider software, called [OpenID Hub](https://pypi.org/project/oidc-hub), an essential piece for inviting members to join your team while ensuring exclusive access to Nextcloud and Mattermost applications for authorized members only.

## Identity Provider

The tool provides you with [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) user management and [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) that includes invitations for new members to join the team, secure password management, and recovery.
