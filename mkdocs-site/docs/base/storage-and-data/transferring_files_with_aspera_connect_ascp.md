ascp is a software used for transferring data to and from Aspera transfer servers where you have license credentials. A common use case is uploading a dataset to a data repository. 

Many transfer servers will require an up-to-date version of the software (now called Aspera Connect). Due to changes in the software, you may need to install this updated version locally. Please see below for details.

=ascp 3.5.4= 
This software is available as a module in older software stacks.

If the server you are trying to transfer data to is incompatible with this older version, you may get an error such as

<pre>
Error with Aspera:

ascp: failed to authenticate, exiting.

Session Stop  (Error: failed to authenticate)
</pre>

=Aspera Connect/ascp 4+= 

In order to use Aspera Connect (formerly ascp) you will need to [install it in one of your local directories](installing_software_in_your_home_directory.md).

1. Copy the link for the latest Linux version of the software from the [Aspera Connect website](https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect).

2. Go to the directory where you want to install the software, e.g. your /home directory.

3. Download the software in this directory with wget.

` wget link-i-copied-here `

4. Extract the software from the archive.

` tar -zxf ibm-aspera-connect_some_version_linux.tar.gz `

5. Run the setup script.

` bash ibm-aspera-connect_some_version_linux.sh `

5a. Make the library files executable:

` chmod u+x ~/.aspera/connect/plugins/*/*.so ~/.aspera/connect/lib/* `

6. Run the setrpaths script.
 
` setrpaths.sh --path $HOME/.aspera `

7. (Optional) add the ascp binaries to your PATH:

` export PATH=~/.aspera/connect/bin:$PATH`
