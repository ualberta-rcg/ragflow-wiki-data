Installation of software packages within the Alliance software environment is always performed using scripts. We use multiple tools, including [EasyBuild](https://easybuild.io/), [Gentoo Overlays](https://overlays.gentoo.org/) (starting in 2020), and [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) (formerly). This software environment can be [used on any computer in the world](accessing-cvmfs.md) thanks to [CVMFS](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

We also track all changes and new installations made to the software environment through [Git](git.md), and you can see a list of recent changes in the links below.
