[Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai) is a <i>meta machine learning platform</i> designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle. By using wandb, you can track, compare, explain and reproduce machine learning experiments.

== Using wandb on Alliance clusters == 

=== Availability on compute nodes ===  

Full usage of <tt>wandb</tt> on compute nodes requires internet access as well as access to Google Cloud Storage, both of which may not be available depending on the cluster:

== Users from MILA and other eligible groups == 

Members of the MILA Québec AI Institute may use <tt>wandb</tt> on any of our clusters with internet access, provided that they use a valid **Mila-org** Weights & Biases account to log into <tt>wandb</tt>. Please see the table above for more information on modules required for using <tt>wandb</tt> on each cluster.

Other groups are known to have made arrangements with Weights & Biases to bypass calls to the Google Cloud Storage API. Please contact your PI to find out if your group has made such arrangements.

== Narval, Rorqual and TamIA == 

While it is possible to upload basic metrics to Weights&Biases during a job on Narval, Rorqual and TamIA, the wandb package will automatically attempt to upload information about your environment to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is not allowed on the compute nodes of these clusters. This will result in a crash during or at the very end of a training run. Your job may also freeze until it reaches its wall time, thereby wasting resources. It is not currently possible to disable this behaviour. Note that uploading artifacts to W&B with `wandb.save()` also requires access to Google Cloud Storage and will cause your job to freeze or crash.

You can still use wandb by enabling the [`offline`](https://docs.wandb.ai/library/cli#wandb-offline) mode. In this mode, wandb will write all metrics, logs and artifacts to the local disk and will not attempt to sync anything to the Weights&Biases service on the internet. After your jobs finish running, you can sync their wandb content to the online service by running the command [`wandb sync`](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli#wandb-sync) on the login node.

Note that [Comet.ml](comet.ml.md) is a product very similar to Weights & Biases, and works on Narval, Rorqual and TamIA.

== Example == 

The following is an example of how to use wandb to track experiments in offline mode. To run in online mode, load the module <tt>httpproxy</tt> on applicable clusters and follow the comments on the example script below.

**`wandb-test.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=YOUR_ACCOUNT
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2 # At least two cpus is recommended - one for the main process and one for the wandB process
#SBATCH --mem=4G       
#SBATCH --time=0-03:00
#SBATCH --output=%N-%j.out

module load python
virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate
pip install --no-index wandb

### Save your wandb API key in your .bash_profile or replace $API_KEY with your actual API key. Uncomment the line below and comment out "wandb offline" if running in online mode ###

#wandb login $API_KEY 

wandb offline

python wandb-test.py
```

The script wandb-test.py is a simple example of metric logging. See [W&B's full documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai) for more options.

{{File
  |name=wandb-test.py
  |lang="python"
  |contents=
import wandb

wandb.init(project="wandb-pytorch-test", settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="fork"))

for my_metric in range(10):
    wandb.log({'my_metric': my_metric})

}}

After a training run in offline mode, there will be a new folder `./wandb/offline-run*`. You can send the metrics to the server using the command `wandb sync ./wandb/offline-run*`. Note that using `*` will sync all runs.
