## Introduction

[VTune](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/vtune-profiler.html) is Intel's Performance Analysis tool for applications and systems. It is capable of [analyzing both OpenMP and MPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/itac-vtune-mpi-openmp-tutorial-lin/top.html) based applications.

## Software module

To load the module on any Alliance cluster run:

```bash
module load vtune
```

## Tool renaming

!!! important "Intel VTune Naming Changes"
    The content of this page is largely concerned with the legacy version named Intel® VTune™ Amplifier. Please note this tool has been renamed throughout Intel's documentation in latest versions (newer than the latest `vtune` module versions presently available on Alliance clusters) from Intel® VTune™ Amplifier to Intel® VTune™ Profiler. Likewise, the application commands `amplxe-cl` and `amplxe-gui` have been renamed to `vtune` and `vtune-gui` for both the command line and graphical tools respectively. Further information can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-help/top/launch.html).

## Analysis types

To collect analysis information run:

```bash
vtune -collect <analysis-type> <target_exe> <exe_arguments>
```

where `<analysis-type>` should be replaced by one of the available analysis, e.g., hotspots, and `<target_exe>` is the path to the executable you would like to analyze.

!!! tip "Compilation Recommendations for Accurate Results"
    It is recommended to compile your executable with the "` -g`" option and to use the same optimization level as normal so as to obtain accurate results.

A listing of version specific argument options and several usage examples may be displayed on the command line by running `vtune -help`, after loading the vtune module. Complete downloadable documentation for Parallel Studio XE (including VTune) for all recent versions can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/download-documentation-intel-parallel-studio-xe-current-previous.html). The latest version of the Intel VTune Profiler User Guide may be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-help/top.html).

## Create reports

To create a report run this command:

```bash
vtune -report <report-type>
```

where `<report-type>` is the type of the report to generate, e.g., hotspots. See also:

*   [generating command-line reports](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-amplifier-help-generating-command-line-reports)

## Matrix example

Analyze and generate a summary report for the Intel Matrix Sample Project run from the command line with 4 cores:

```bash
salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --ntasks=1 --mem=16G --account=def-yours
module load StdEnv/2020 vtune
cp -a $EBROOTVTUNE/vtune/$EBVERSIONVTUNE*/samples/en/C++/matrix .
cd matrix/linux
make icc
vtune -collect hotspots ../matrix
vtune -report summary
```

The latest version of `matrix_multiply` (which uses cmake to build) can be found [here](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Tools/VTuneProfiler).

## Graphical mode

The Intel Matrix Sample Project can also be run using Vtune in GUI mode as explored [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-hotspots-tutorial-linux-c/top/run-hotspots-analysis.html). To run VTune over VNC follow the below directions depending on which system you wish to use. Running VTune graphically can be useful to generate [command line configurations from the GUI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-help/top/analyze-performance/control-data-collection/generating-command-line-configuration-from-gui.html).

### Cluster nodes

1.  Connect to a cluster compute or login node with [TigerVNC](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/VNC#Connect)
2.  `module load StdEnv/2020 vtune`
3.  `vtune-gui`

### VDI nodes

1.  Connect to gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca with [TigerVNC](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/VNC#VDI_Nodes)
2.  `module load CcEnv StdEnv/2020 vtune`
3.  `vtune-gui`

## MPI example

First, load the latest VTune module.

```bash
module load StdEnv/2020
module load vtune
```

Then compile your MPI program as you usually would and run it inside a job or in an interactive session started by an `salloc` command using:

```bash
srun aps your_mpi_program.x
```

After the program finishes, the profiling data will be stored in a directory called `aps_result_YYYYMMDD` where YYYYMMDD is the current date.

There is a lot of information you can extract from that data. To get the basic summary report of your program's performance, run:

```bash
aps-report -D aps_result_YYYYMMDD
```

where you would replace `YYYYMMDD` to match the actual directory that has been created. This command creates an HTML file, which can be copied to your own computer and viewed in a browser. The report will clearly identify performance issues that are affecting your code.
