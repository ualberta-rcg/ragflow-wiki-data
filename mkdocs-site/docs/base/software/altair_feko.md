= Introduction = 
[Altair FEKO](https://altairhyperworks.com/product/FEKO) is a comprehensive computational electromagnetics (CEM) software used widely in the telecommunications, automobile, aerospace and defense industries.

= Licensing = 
We are a hosting provider for FEKO. This means that we have FEKO software installed on our clusters, but we do not provide a generic license accessible to everyone. However, you may already have a license server for your research group. 

== Configuring your own license file == 
Our module for FEKO is designed to look for license information in a few places. One of those places is your home folder. If you have your own license server, you can write the information to access it in the following format: 

**`feko.lic`**
```lua
setenv("ALTAIR_LICENSE_PATH", "<port>@<hostname>")
```

and put this file in the folder <tt>$HOME/.licenses/</tt>. Note that firewall configuration will need to be done on both our side and yours. Please get in touch with our [Technical support](technical-support.md) to arrange this.
