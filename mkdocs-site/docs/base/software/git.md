[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a distributed, fast and secure source code management tool. The official Git website is [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for the Linux project and is currently maintained by Junio Hamano.

## Operating principle
Contrary to older source code management tools, Git works in a distributed way. This means that developers do not depend on a central repository to commit their changes. Each Git repository contains the full history of the project. Each Git object (changeset, file, directory) is the leaf of a tree with multiple branches. Developing a project with Git is based on a model in which one branch corresponds to one feature. Many revisions of the feature may be archived before the branch gets merged with the main trunk. For a detailed explanation of branch development, we recommend reading [this page](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

One especially interesting technique is *cherry-picking*, which is essentially taking part of a branch and merging it with another one.

## Basic usage
Generally, a project developer will:

1.  configure the global Git environment;
2.  clone or create a repository;
3.  make changes;
4.  commit changes;
5.  push changes to another repository.

Since Git is distributed, there may not be an authoritative repository.

### Configuring the global Git environment
This section is based on the [Software Carpentry - *Version Control with Git*](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html) lesson. When you start developing on a new system, you want to configure:

*   Your name and email address, which will be associated with every commit.
    !!! warning "Public Information"
        Note: this information will become **public** if you push your revisions to a public repository.
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "First-name Last-name"
    git config --global user.email "email@address.ca"
    ```
*   Limit yourself to only four threads, otherwise, your `git clone` commands may fail if they are using too many threads.
    ```bash
    git config --global pack.threads 4
    ```
*   If you are not used to `vi`, you can set a different text editor for your commit messages.
    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
    ```
*   Finally, you may want to redefine the default name for the initial branch name. For example, `main`.
    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

To list all options set in the global environment, run the following command.
```bash
git config --list --global
```

### Creating or cloning a repository
The first step is usually to create your own repository, or to clone an existing one.

To create a repository:
```bash
git init my-project
```

To clone a repository:
```bash
git clone git://github.com/git/git.git
```

### Committing a change
When the repository is ready, you change directory and edit the file.
```bash
cd my-project
nano file.txt
```

When work is done, you add the file
```bash
git add file.txt
```
then commit the change
```bash
git commit
```

If the repository was cloned, it is now possible to push your changes to the original repository with
```bash
git push origin main
```

In the above command, *origin* is the remote repository and *main* is the current branch that will be pushed.

You might have to use `git push origin master` for older git repositories.

## Hosting Git repositories
[GitHub](http://github.com) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) are two of the main Git repository hosting services. They are both available for commercial projects as well as free projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to create thread
If you see:

```
fatal: unable to create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable
fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output
```

This is caused by resource limitations on the cluster login nodes. The solution is to limit the number of threads to 2. Use the following command on each cluster:

```bash
git config --global pack.threads "2"
