## General

DL_POLY is a general purpose classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software. It provides scalable performance from a single processor workstation to a high performance parallel computer. DL_POLY_4 offers fully parallel I/O as well as a NetCDF alternative to the default ASCII trajectory file.

There is a mailing list [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DLPOLY).

## License limitations

**DL_POLY** is now [open source](https://gitlab.com/DL%20POLY%20Classic/dl%20poly) and it does not require registration. A new module **dl_poly4/5.1.0** is already installed under **StdEnv/2023** and it is accessible for all users. However, if you would like to use the previous versions (**dl_poly4/4.10.0** and/or **dl_poly4/4.08**), you should contact [support](../support/technical_support.md) and ask to be added to the POSIX group that controls access to DL_POLY4. There is no need to register on DL_POLY website.

## Modules

To see which versions of DL_POLY are installed on our systems, run `module spider dl_poly4`. See [Using modules](../programming/modules.md) for more about `module` subcommands.

To load the version **5.x**, use:

```bash
module load StdEnv/2023  intel/2023.2.1  openmpi/4.1.5 dl_poly4/5.1.0
```

To load the previous version 4.10.0, use:

```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2020.1.217  openmpi/4.0.3 dl_poly4/4.10.0
```

Note that this version requires to be added to a POSIX group as explained above in [License limitations](#license-limitations).

We do not currently provide a module for the Java GUI interface.

## Scripts and examples

The input files shown below (CONTROL and FIELD) were taken from example TEST01 that can be downloaded from the page of [DL_POLY examples](ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp5/DL_POLY/DL_POLY_4.0/DATA/).

To start a simulation, one must have at least three files:

*   **CONFIG**: simulation box (atomic coordinates)
*   **FIELD**: force field parameters
*   **CONTROL**: simulation parameters (time step, number of MD steps, simulation ensemble, ...etc.)
