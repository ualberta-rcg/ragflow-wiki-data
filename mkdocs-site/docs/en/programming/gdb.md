[GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) is a debugger used to investigate software problem.
GDB is an acronym saying <i>GDB: The <u>G</u>NU Project <u>D</u>e<u>b</u>ugger</i>

## Description 
With a debugger, it is possible to quickly find the cause of a problem in a piece of software.
Often it is used to resolve [segmentation faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault).
If you desire to resolve a problem relating to memory (for example, a 
[memory leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)), we recommend using [Valgrind](debugging_and_profiling#valgrind.md).

## Use cases 
### Finding a bug with the debugger 
In this section, the following program is used:
{{File
|name= program.cpp 
|lines=yes
|contents=
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char**argv) {
	
	vector<int> numbers;

	int iterator = 1000;

	while(iterator --) {
		numbers.push_back(iterator);
	}

	cout << numbers[1000000] << endl;

	return 0;
}
}}
This program generates a segmentation fault when it is ran.

```bash

```

We may then run the program inside the debugger. Note that we compiled using the option <tt>-g</tt> to include debugging symbols within the binary and allow the debugger to provide more information on the bug. We run the program inside the debugger using

```bash

```
2, argv0x7fffffffda88) at program.cpp:15
15		cout << numbers[1000000] << endl;
Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install glibc-2.16-31.fc18.x86_64 libgcc-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64 libstdc++-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64

(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000000000400c17 in main (argc2, argv0x7fffffffda88) at program.cpp:15
|
}}
So, the above error is caused by line 15. The code tries to use index 1000000, but the array only contains 1000 elements.

### Finding the cause of a segmentation fault using a <tt>core</tt> file 
In this example, we use the same program as in the previous section. We however do so without using the debugger directly. This is useful for a bug that happens a long time after the program has started.

To find the cause for this error, a <tt>core</tt> file must be generated. To do this, you must activate the creation of such files.

```bash
ulimit -c unlimited
```

Executing the same program again, a <tt>core</tt> file is written.

```bash

```

Using the <tt>program</tt> binary executable and the <tt>core</tt> file, it is possible to trace its execution
up to the error.

```bash

```
1, argv0x7fff2315c848) at
program.cpp:15
15              cout << numbers[1000000] << endl;
Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install
glibc-2.16-31.fc18.x86_64 libgcc-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64
libstdc++-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64

(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000000000400c17 in main (argc1, argv0x7fff2315c848) at
program.cpp:15
|
}}
We here get the same result as if we had run it inside the debugger.

### Attaching the debugger to a running process 
It is possible to debug a process that is already running, for example a job running on one of the compute nodes. To do so, we first need the process ID.

```bash

```
 grep firefox  grep -v grep
seb      12691  6.4  7.5 1539672 282656 ?      Sl   08:53   6:48 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox http://www.google.ca/
}}

After that, it is possible to attach the debugger directly.

```bash
gdb attach 12691
```

After having done this, a lot of information is displayed.

There are many commands available within GDB. One of the most useful is <tt>backtrace</tt>, or <tt>bt</tt>.
This commands shows the current call stack.

```bash
quit
A debugging session is active.

Inferior 1 [process 12691] will be detached.

Quit anyway? (y or n) y
Detaching from program: /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox, process 12691
```

## Advanced usage 
In the previous sections, we used the <tt>run</tt> and <tt>backtrace</tt> commands. Many more commands are available to debug in an interactive way, by stopping the program. For example, you can set breakpoints on functions or lines of code, or whenever a given variable is modified. When execution is interrupted, you can analyse the state of the program by printing the value of variables. The following table contains a list of the main commands.

### Displaying STL structures 
By default, GDB does not display C++ STL structures very well. Many solutions are given [here](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/STLSupport). The simplest solution is probably [this one](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GDB-Commands.html#STLDEREF), which is to copy [this file](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/src/dbinit_stl_views-1.03.txt) in your home folder, with the name <tt>~/.gdbinit</tt>.
