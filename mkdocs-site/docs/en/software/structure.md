## Description

Structure is a free software package for using multilocus genotype data to investigate population structure. Its uses include inferring the presence of distinct populations, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, identifying migrants and admixed individuals, and estimating population allele frequencies in situations where many individuals are migrants or admixed. It can be applied to most of the commonly-used genetic markers, including SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs and AFLPs.

## Installed versions

At the time of writing, Structure v2.3.4 has been installed (module: `structure/2.3.4`).
Please look on page [Available software](available-software.md) for module `structure` for an up-to-date list of installed versions.

## Usage

When starting *structure* without any command-line options, it expects to find the following three files in the current working directory:
* `mainparams`
* `extraparams`
* and a data file. The name of the data file can either be set by the *INFILE* parameter in `mainparams` or supplied via the command line (-i).

Please refer to §7 "Running *structure* from the command line" in the Structure Documentation for a complete description of the available parameters and file-formats. There are also several command-line options to supply alternative filenames or override options. e.g.: -m (mainparams), -e (extraparams), -i (input file), -o (output file).
See section §7.4 in the Structure Documentation.

Here is an example submission script:

```bash title="structure_job.sh"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=0-0:30           # time limit (D-HH:MM)
module load structure
structure -i data_file1  -o results1
```

## Running Structure in parallel: StrAuto & StructureHarvester

Structure in itself is not able to run in parallel; however, as population structure inference using the Evanno-method involves multiple structure-runs, the tools StrAuto and StructureHarvester have been developed to automate the process of setting up such runs and aggregating their results respectively.

### Practical considerations

There is an example for running StrAuto jobs on HPC clusters using the Slurm Workload manager outlined in chapter 8 of the StrAuto User Guide.

!!! warning
    The example works best when the total number of Structure runs is a multiple of the number of requested tasks, as otherwise some of the allocated CPUs will sit idle while the last Structure runs are being executed. This may lead to a significant waste of computing resources.

!!! warning
    Moreover, the requested maximum job time needs to be sufficiently large to accommodate multiple subsequent Structure runs. While this can be a sensible choice for relatively short runs, jobs with long walltimes will typically have to wait longer until they are dispatched due to [job scheduling policies](job-scheduling-policies.md#time-limits).
    Therefore, in cases where an individual Structure run takes more than just a few hours to finish, we recommend submitting each Structure run as an individual job to Slurm.

### Running a set of longer Structure runs

The script `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` shown at the bottom of this section is designed to help you run Structure jobs on Compute Canada HPC clusters that use the Slurm Workload manager. It requires Structure, StrAuto, and StructureHarvester.

**Usage:**

*   Place the `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` script shown below into a directory along with:
    *   `strauto_1.py` and `input.py` from StrAuto.
    *   `structureHarvester.py` and `harvesterCore.py` from StructureHarvester.
    *   The file with the Structure dataset e.g. `my_dataset.str`.
*   Make `create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py` executable with:

    ```bash
    chmod u+x create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py
    ```

    *   You should now have the following files:

    ```bash
    ls -F
    ```

    ```text
    create_strauto_slurm_scripts.py*  harvesterCore.py
    input.py                          my_dataset.str
    strauto_1.py*                     structureHarvester.py*
    ```

*   Edit the settings in `input.py` as described in the StrAuto User Manual.
    *   Make sure to set the option `parallel = True` (question 23).
*   Adjust the parameters in this file (lines 65-70):
    *   Set `max_jobtime` to a duration where you can be reasonably sure that no individual Structure run takes longer than this.
    *   In cases where a user can submit under multiple Slurm-accounts `slurm_account` can be used to specify under which account to submit.
    *   To avoid overloading the Scheduler, the submission helper script delays each submission by a time defined by `submit_delay`.
*   Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    module load python/2.7
    ```

    ```bash
    ./strauto_1.py
    ```

    ```text

    Creating submission helper script...
    created helper script: "submit_strauto_jobs.sh"

    Creating postprocessing script...
    created post-script: "post_strauto.sh"
    ```

*   Submit the jobs with:

    ```bash
    bash submit_strauto_jobs.sh
    ```

    ```text
    Submitted batch job 12345001
    Submitted batch job 12345002
    [...]
    Submitted batch job 12345040
    ```

*   After all jobs have completed, run `bash post_strauto.sh` to aggregate the results and run StructureHarvester.
