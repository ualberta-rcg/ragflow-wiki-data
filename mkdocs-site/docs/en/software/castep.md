## Installing CASTEP
For example, with version `20.11`:
# You must [**get the archive file that contains the installer**](http://www.castep.org/get_castep); this file should be named `CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz`.
# Upload the `CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz` file to your `/home/$USER` folder on the cluster you intend to use.
# On the cluster, run the command:
 [name@server ~]$ eb CASTEP-20.11-iofbf-2020a.eb --sourcepath=$HOME --disable-enforce-checksums
Once this command has completed, log out from the cluster and log back in.

## Using CASTEP
You should be able to load the module with:
 [name@server ~]$ module load castep
On a compute node, the CASTEP executable can be used like an [MPI application](running_jobs#mpi_job.md):
 [name@server ~]$ srun castep.mpi seedname
Where input files would be `seedname.cell` and `seedname.param` (i.e. "seedname" could be a different name).
