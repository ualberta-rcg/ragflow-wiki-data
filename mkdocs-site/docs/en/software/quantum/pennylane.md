[PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) is an open-source software platform for differentiable quantum computing that was launched in 2018 by Xanadu, a quantum technology company based in Toronto, Canada. It allows quantum circuits to be designed and run on a variety of quantum simulators and hardware. PennyLane is designed to facilitate the simulation, optimization, and training of hybrid quantum algorithms, which combine classical and quantum processing. [The first version was published as an open-source project on GitHub.](https://github.com/calculquebec/pennylane-snowflurry)

## Features
PennyLane offers several features to facilitate research and development in differentiable quantum computing.

## Unified quantum interface
PennyLane provides a unified quantum interface that allows you to design quantum circuits and run them on different quantum simulators and hardware. PennyLane supports several popular quantum simulators, such as [Qiskit](qiskit-en.md), [CirQ](cirq-en.md), Strawberry Field, and QuTip. PennyLane also supports several quantum hardware, including Xanadu, IBM, Rigetti and IonQ quantum devices.

Calcul Québec has developed a [PennyLane-CalculQuebec plugin](https://github.com/calculquebec/pennylane-snowflurry\) that uses the PennyLane interface to design and run quantum circuits on [MonarQ](monarq-en.md).

### Integration with machine learning libraries
PennyLane seamlessly integrates with popular machine learning libraries such as [TensorFlow](tensorflow.md) and [PyTorch](pytorch.md), allowing you to use machine learning tools to build hybrid quantum machine learning models and optimize quantum circuits.

### Quantum circuit optimization
Using differentiable optimization techniques and combining classical and quantum differentiation methods, PennyLane optimizes quantum circuit parameters to solve a variety of problems

### Visualization tools 
PennyLane provides visualization tools to help understand how quantum circuits work.

### Community and development 
PennyLane is an open-source project with an active community of developers and users. The project is constantly updated with new features and improvements, and anyone can contribute to the development of the platform.

== Using PennyLane with MonarQ == 
[MonarQ](monarq-en.md) is designed to be programmed with [Snowflurry](snowflurry-en.md), a Julia-based software library developed by Anyon Systems. However, with the PennyLane-CalculQuebec plugin, PennyLane circuits can be created using Snowflurry in the background. This allows circuits to be run on [MonarQ](monarq-en.md) while still benefiting from the features and development environment offered by PennyLane. See the [PennyLane-CalculQuebec documentation for installation and usage guides](https://github.com/calculquebec/pennylane-snowflurry\).

A [quantum transpiler](transpileur-quantique-fr.md) is also available to optimize PennyLane circuits on MonarQ. 

## Creating a virtual environment 
[Let’s create a virtual environment](python#creating_and_using_a_virtual_environment.md) to use PennyLane.

```bash

```
X.Y.Z
|python -c "import pennylane"
}}
where <tt>X.Y.Z</tt> is the version number.

You can also put the last three commands in a pennylane-reqs.txt file and call the file inside a session with the commands

```bash
pip install --no-index -r pennylane-reqs.txt
```

You can now [submit the job to the scheduler](running-jobs.md).

## Use case: Bell states 
Let's start by creating the virtual environment, as described above.

We will then generate the first Bell state using PennyLane.
    import pennylane as qml

   #  Define the quantum circuit to generate the first Bell state.
    def bell_circuit():
     qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])

   # Define the quantum circuit simulator.
    dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

   # Define the quantum circuit as a QNode function. 
    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def generate_bell_state():
     bell_circuit()
     return qml.state()

   # Generate and display the first Bell state.
    bell_state_0 = generate_bell_state()
   print("First Bell State :", bell_state_0)
   Premier état de Bell :[0.70710678+0.j 0.        +0.j 0.        +0.j 0.70710678+0.j]
