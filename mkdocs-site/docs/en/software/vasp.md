*The Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.*
Reference: [VASP website](https://www.vasp.at/)

## Licensing

VASP can only be used by research groups that have been licensed by the developers, VASP Software GmbH. Your PI (principal investigator, professor) must register at the [VASP website](https://www.vasp.at/) and obtain a **licence**.

Once you have a **licence**, if you wish to use the prebuilt VASP binaries on [Fir](fir.md), [Nibi](../clusters/nibi.md), or [Trillium](../clusters/trillium.md), contact [Technical support](../support/technical_support.md) requesting access to VASP with the following information:
*   Include **licence** holder (your PI) information:
    *   Name
    *   Email address
    *   Department and institution (university)
*   Include **licence** information:
    *   Version of the VASP **licence** (**VASP version 5 or version 6**)
    *   **Licence number**
    *   Provide an updated list of who is allowed to use your VASP **licence**. For example, forward to us the most recent email from the VASP **licence** administrator that contains the list of licensed users.

If you are licensed for version 6 you may also use version 5, but a version 5 **licence** does not permit you to use version 6.

You may also choose to install VASP yourself, according to the terms of your **licence**. See [Building VASP yourself](#building-vasp-yourself) below.

### Why?

VASP Software GmbH will only grant **licences** to groups that are hired by a single legal entity, which is incompatible with the way we operate. We have tried to negotiate an agreement with the licensor which would let us install the software everywhere on our infrastructure, but without success. Please read the terms of your own **licence**, as you are likely subject to the same restriction. This limits the support we can offer to users who need help installing the software.

Simon Fraser University, the University of Waterloo, and the University of Toronto own Fir, Nibi, and Trillium, respectively, and have **licences** with VASP. Some of their employees are therefore allowed to install specific versions of VASP on those clusters and provide limited support.

## Using prebuilt VASP

To load prebuilt VASP on [Fir](fir.md) and [Nibi](../clusters/nibi.md), please do the following:

For **vasp/5.4.4**
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0
module load vasp/5.4.4
```
For **vasp/6.4.2**
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0
module load vasp/6.4.2
```

1.  Run `module spider vasp` to see which versions are available.
2.  Choose your version and run `module spider vasp/<version>` to see which dependencies you need to load for this particular version.
3.  Load the dependencies and the VASP module, for example:
    ```bash
    module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0
    module load vasp/6.4.2
    ```
See [Using modules](../programming/modules.md) for more information.

To use VASP on [Trillium](../clusters/trillium.md), modules may be loaded as follows:

For **vasp/5.4.4**
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0
module load imkl/2023.2.0
module use /opt/software/commercial/modules
module load vasp/5.4.4
```

For **vasp/6.4.2**
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2023.2.1 intelmpi/2021.9.0 hdf5/1.14.2
module use /opt/software/commercial/modules
module load vasp/6.4.2
```

For **vasp/6.6.1**
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 intel/2025.2.0 intelmpi/2021.16.0 hdf5/1.14.6
module use /opt/software/commercial/modules
module load vasp/6.6.1
```

For **vasp/6.4.2-gpu** on the **Trillium GPU** subcluster
```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 nvhpc/25.1 cuda/12.6 nccl/2.26.2 imkl/2023.2.0 hdf5/1.14.5
module use /opt/software/commercial/modules
module load vasp/6.4.2-gpu
```

For general usage of Trillium, please see the [Trillium Quickstart](../clusters/trillium_quickstart.md) page.

### Pseudopotential files

All pseudopotentials have been downloaded from the official VASP website and untarred. They are all located in `$EBROOTVASP/pseudopotentials/` on Fir and Nibi and can be accessed once the VASP module is loaded.

### Executable programs

**For VASP-4.6**, executable files are:
*   `vasp` for standard NVT calculations with non gamma k points
*   `vasp-gamma` for standard NVT calculations with only gamma points
*   `makeparam` to estimate how much memory is required to run VASP for a particular cluster

**For VASP-5.4.1, 5.4.4 and 6.1.0 (without CUDA support)**, executable files are:
*   `vasp_std` for standard NVT calculations with non gamma k points
*   `vasp_gam` for standard NVT calculations with only gamma points
*   `vasp_ncl` for NPT calculations with non gamma k points

**For VASP-5.4.4 and 6.1.0 (with CUDA support)**, executable files are:
*   `vasp_gpu` for standard NVT calculations with gamma and non gamma k points
*   `vasp_gpu_ncl` for NPT calculations with gamma and non gamma k points

Two extensions have also been incorporated:
*   [Transition State Tools](http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/)
*   [VASPsol](https://github.com/henniggroup/VASPsol)

If you need a version of VASP that does not appear here, you can either build it yourself (see below) or [write to us](../support/technical_support.md) and ask that it be built and installed.

## Vasp-GPU

Vasp-GPU executable files run on both GPUs and CPUs of a node. Calculation on a GPU is much more expensive than on a CPU, therefore we highly recommend performing a benchmark using one or two GPUs to ensure maximum performance from GPU usage.

A benchmark of a Si crystal containing 256 Si-atoms in the simulation box showed the following:
*   Performance for GPU=1,2 and CPU=1 was more than 5 times better compared to GPU=0 and CPU=1.
*   A comparison of calculations with GPU=1 and GPU=2 indicated that there was not much performance gain from GPU=1 to GPU=2. In fact, GPU=2 utilization was around 50% in our monitoring system for this benchmark.

Therefore, we recommend users to first perform a similar benchmark for their own system to ensure they are not wasting computer resources.

## Example of a VASP job script

The following is a job script to run VASP in parallel using the Slurm job scheduler:

=== "vasp_job.sh"
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --account=<ACCOUNT>
    #SBATCH --ntasks=4             # number of MPI processes
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024M    # memory
    #SBATCH --time=0-00:05         # time (DD-HH:MM)
    module load intel/2020.1.217 intelmpi/2019.7.217 vasp/<VERSION>
    mpirun <VASP>
    ```

*   The above job script requests four CPU cores and 4096MB memory (4x1024MB).
*   `<ACCOUNT>` is a Slurm account name; see [Accounts and projects](../running-jobs/running_jobs.md#accounts-and-projects) to know what to enter there.
*   `<VERSION>` is the number for the VASP version you want to use: 4.6, 5.4.1, 5.4.4 or 6.1.0.
*   Use `module spider vasp/<VERSION>` to see how you can change this particular version.
*   `<VASP>` is the name of the executable. Refer to section *Executable programs* above for the executables you can select for each version.

=== "vasp_gpu_job.sh"
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --account=<ACCOUNT>
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1      # number of CPU processes
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:p100:1      # Number of GPU type:p100 (valid type only for cedar)
    #SBATCH --mem=3GB              # memory
    #SBATCH --time=0-00:05         # time (DD-HH:MM)
    module load intel/2020.1.217 cuda/11.0 openmpi/4.0.3 vasp/<VERSION>
    mpirun <VASP>
    ```

*   The above job script requests one CPU core and 1024MB memory.
*   The above job script requests one GPU type p100 which is only available on Cedar. For other clusters, please see the [GPU types available](../running-jobs/using_gpus_with_slurm.md).
*   The above job uses `srun` to run VASP.

VASP uses four input files named as INCAR, KPOINTS, POSCAR, POTCAR. It is best to prepare VASP input files in a separate directory for each job. To submit the job from that directory, use:
```bash
sbatch vasp_job.sh
```

If you do not know how much memory you need for your job, prepare all your input files and then run `makeparam` in an [interactive job submission](../running-jobs/running_jobs.md#interactive-jobs). Then use the result as required memory for the next run. However, for a more accurate estimate for future jobs, check the maximum stack size used by [completed jobs](../running-jobs/running_jobs.md) and use this as the memory requirement per processor for the next job.

If you want to use 32 or more cores, please read about [whole-node scheduling](../running-jobs/job_scheduling_policies.md#whole-nodes-versus-cores).

## Building VASP yourself

If you are licensed to use VASP and have access to VASP source code, you can install various versions of VASP in your `/home` directory on all our clusters using the following [EasyBuild](../programming/easybuild.md) commands.

```bash
eb -f [RECIPE NAME] --sourcepath=[SOURCEPATH]
```

where `[SOURCEPATH]` is the directory containing the VASP source code and `[RECIPE NAME]` is the name of the recipe. The first tab of the table below shows the list of available recipes along with the corresponding required source files. In this table VTSTtools and vaspSOL are Transition State Tools and VASPsol extensions respectively. The second tab of this table shows the list of the libraries that are included with VASP. You may download the source code from the [VASP website](https://www.vasp.at/). Running the command will take some time, perhaps more than an hour. Once it is done, you will be able to load and run VASP using `module` commands just as explained above in [Using prebuilt VASP](#using-prebuilt-vasp).

Alternatively to build a custom version of VASP, please see [Installing software in your home directory](../getting-started/installing_software_in_your_home_directory.md) and [Installing VASP 5](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Installing_VASP.5.X.X) or [Installing VASP 6](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Installing_VASP.6.X.X).
