## Database as a Service (DBaaS)
If a VM is not sufficient to run a database load, a managed database can be used instead, the current offering includes MySQL/MariaDB and Postgres on a physical system.
The database systems as well as all databases are being backed up once a day. The backups are archived for 3 months.
To request access, please contact [Technical support](technical-support.md).

!!! note "Required Information"
    Please provide in your request the client network or IP address you will access the database from.

| Type | Hostname | TCP port |
| :--- | :------- | :------- |
| mysql | dbaas101.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca | 3306 |
| pgsql | dbaas101.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca | 5432 |

The CA certificate which is used to sign the host certificate for the service, is available for download [here](http://repo.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca/dbaas-ca.pem).

## PostgreSQL Database
Your instance will use a SSL connection to connect to the DBaaS host.
The example below connects to the DBaaS host, as **user01** and uses the database **dbinstance** via a SSL connection.

```console
psql --set "sslmode=require" -h dbaas101.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca -U user01 -d dbinstance
Password for user user01:
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
dbinstance=> \l dbinstance
                               List of databases
    Name    | Owner  | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    | Access privileges
------------+--------+----------+-------------+-------------+-------------------
 dbinstance | user01 | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | user01=CTc/user01
(1 row)
```

The SSL connection is enforced and plain text connections fail.

## MariaDB/MySQL Database
Your instance will use a SSL connection to connect to the DBaaS host.
The example below connects to the DBaaS host, as **user01** and uses the database **dbinstance** via a SSL connection.

```console
mysql --ssl -h dbaas101.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca -u user01 -p dbinstance
Enter password:
MariaDB [dbinstance]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| dbinstance         |
| information_schema |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

If you try to use a plain text connection, your authentication will fail.

```console
mysql -h dbaas101.arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca -u user01 -p dbinstance
Enter password:
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'user01'@'client.arbutus' (using password: YES)
