!!! warning "Try JupyterLab first"
    This page is for advanced usage of VNC. In many cases, it is much simpler and sufficient to use VNC through your browser, and [Desktop](jupyterlab.md#desktop). Please consider using this before you try the instructions below.

To remotely start the graphical user interface (GUI) of a program, X11 forwarding over [SSH](../getting-started/ssh.md) is commonly used. However, the performance of this approach is often too slow to perform smooth complex graphics rotations. A much better alternative is to use [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) to connect to a remote desktop.

## Setup

To begin, a VNC client will need to be installed on your desktop. A TigerVNC package is available for Windows, macOS and most Linux distributions. The following shows how to download, install and configure TigerVNC securely for each of these systems.

### Windows

Download and run the latest stable `vncviewer64-x.y.z.exe` version package installer from [the official download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/files/stable/) for example `vncviewer64-1.15.0.exe` (as of April 2025). Make sure you download the viewer and not the server. To create secure tunnels from your desktop to the VNC server as described in the sections below, you will need to open a terminal window and run the SSH command. This may be done using PowerShell standard on Windows 10 since the 1809 update.

### macOS

Install the latest stable DMG package by going to [the official download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/files/stable/) and click the green **Download Latest Version** button for `TigerVNC-1.15.0.dmg` (as of April 2025). Once the download is complete, double click the DMG file to open it. A TigerVNC Viewer icon should appear in a popup window along with a `LICENSE.TXT` and `README.rst` file. To complete the installation, drag the TigerVNC icon that appears into the Applications folder and/or the lower [app dock](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh35859/mac). To remove the popup, you will need to unmount the DMG file. To do this, open a New Finder Window, verify `View->ShowSidebar` is selected, click the small up arrow beside `TigerVNC-1.15.0` in the left side menu and lastly close the finder window. If you are running macOS Monterey 12.2 and [TigerVNC crashes](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/issues/1423) then you must upgrade to this latest version.

### Linux

First install TigerVNC viewer with the package manager for your Linux version:

| Linux Version            | Install Command                          |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Debian, Ubuntu           | `sudo apt-get install tigervnc-viewer`   |
| Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL | `sudo yum install tigervnc`              |
| Gentoo                   | `emerge -av net-misc/tigervnc`           |

Next, start TigerVNC by either finding it in the applications menu or running `vncviewer` on the command line of your laptop.

## Connect

Now you need a VNC server to connect to, such as a temporary VNC server started on a cluster login or compute node as shown below.

### Login Nodes

You may run lightweight applications (that do not require a GPU) within a remote VNC desktop on a cluster login node (memory and CPU time limits apply). To do this, you must first connect to a cluster login node. Using the Nibi cluster to demonstrate:

```bash
laptop:~ $ ssh nibi.alliancecan.ca
```

Next, run `vncserver -list` to check if you have an old unused VNC server(s) still running on whichever Nibi login node you get connected to. If you do, then kill them off by running the following `pkill` command:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ pkill Xvnc -u $USER
```

1) Now you may start your VNC server on the login node as shown here:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ vncserver -idletimeout 86400
Desktop 'TurboVNC: l4.nibi.sharcnet:1 (yourusername)' started on display l4.nibi.sharcnet:1
Starting applications specified in /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2023/x86-64-v3/usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc
Log file is /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log
```

Note that the `vncserver` command provided by `StdEnv/2023` is based on [TurboVNC](https://turbovnc.org). When starting a new VNC server on a login node, `-idletimeout seconds` should be added as shown above. Doing so will ensure your `vncserver` eventually terminates (once S seconds has elapsed with no VNC viewer connections) should you forget to terminate your vncviewer session by clicking `System -> Log out` in the VNC desktop. The first time you start `vncserver`, you will be required to set a password which can be [changed](vncserver-password.md) later. The password will be required to remotely connect to your desktop with a VNC client (such as `vncviewer`). The same password will be required when making [multiple connections](multiple-connections.md) assuming you started your VNC server by appending the additional `-AlwaysShared` option.

2) Now determine which port your VNC server is listening on (5901 for this example) by running `grep` on the log file:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ grep -iE "\sport|kill" /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log
25/08/2025 15:16:20 Listening for VNC connections on TCP port 5901
```

Now you may exit the login node. The VNC server you started will continue running until the time limit you specified (with the `-idletimeout` option) is reached.

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ exit
laptop:~ $
```

3) On your desktop, start an SSH tunnel. Doing this will forward an arbitrary port (5905 in this example) to the port your VNC server is listening on (5901 according to the above).

```bash
laptop:~ $ ssh nibi.computecanada.ca -L 5905:l4:5901
```

4) Next, also on your desktop, either click the *TigerVNC Viewer* application icon and enter `localhost:5905` in the **VNC viewer: Connection details** popup window dialogue box that appears **OR** open another terminal window and specify the following on the command line then hit enter. With either approach, you should next get a popup window requesting the VNC authentication password that you previously setup. After successfully entering the password, your remote Desktop should immediately appear.

```bash
laptop:~ $ vncviewer localhost:5905
```

Although there are no system time limits on the login nodes for processes, there are memory and CPU time limits that any applications you run in your remote desktop will be subject to. If you require more memory, CPU resources, or GPU access for applications you run in your desktop OR for graphics acceleration, then use the following procedure to start your VNC server on a cluster compute node instead and you may request them accordingly as explained with the `salloc` command.

### Compute Nodes

If your program requires memory and/or CPU time limits greater than those provided on a cluster login node(s), then connect to a cluster compute node using the `salloc` command, start a VNC server, and then start a secure tunnel to it (with suitable port forwarding) and connect to it from your desktop with a `vncviewer`. This approach will give you dedicated access to your VNC server on a compute node with full graphical desktop, however by default it will not have hardware-accelerated OpenGL capabilities.

**1) Start a VNC server**

Before starting your VNC server, log into a cluster (such as Nibi) and create a compute node allocation using the `salloc` command (24hr time limit applies). For example, to request an [interactive job](../running-jobs/running_jobs.md#interactive-jobs) using 4 CPUs and 16GB of memory you could use the command:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem=16000 --account=def-piusername
salloc: Pending job allocation 1149016
salloc: job 1149016 queued and waiting for resources
salloc: job 1149016 has been allocated resources
salloc: Granted job allocation 1149016
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes c48 are ready for job
c48(compute node):~ $
```

Once your interactive job has started, set this environment variable to avoid any repetitive desktop errors:

```bash
c48(compute node):~ $ export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=${SLURM_TMPDIR}
```

Then, start a VNC server with `vncserver` noting which compute node your job is running on (`c48` in this example). If unsure, use the `hostname` command to check. The first time you do this, you will be prompted to set a password for your VNC server **DO NOT LEAVE THIS BLANK** otherwise anyone could connect to it and gain access to the files in your account. You may change the password later using the `vncpasswd` command. Continuing with the example:

```bash
c48(compute node):~ $ vncserver
Desktop 'TurboVNC: c48.nibi.sharcnet:1 (yourusername)' started on display c48.nibi.sharcnet:1
Starting applications specified in /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2023/x86-64-v3/usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc
Log file is /home/yourusername/.vnc/c48.nibi.sharcnet:1.log
```

Run the `grep` command on the log file to determine which port your VNC server is listening on:

```bash
c48(compute node):~ $ grep -iE "\sport|kill" /home/yourusername/.vnc/c48.nibi.sharcnet:1.log
26/08/2025 10:43:36 Listening for VNC connections on TCP port 5901
```

**2) Set up an SSH tunnel to the VNC server**

Once your VNC server has been started, you must create a secure "bridge" or "tunnel" from your laptop to the compute node where your VNC server is running (as determined in the previous step above). There are two types of tunnel commands that may be used depending on which cluster you are using.

For all clusters (**except** Nibi), the previously recommended form of the tunnel command `ssh username@clustername -L localforwardedport:computenode:remotelisteningport` may continue to be used. As an example, if a VNC server is started on Rorqual compute node `rc12509` and the local port on your laptop to be forwarded is again 5905, the appropriate tunnel command becomes:

```bash
laptop:~ $ ssh username@rorqual.alliancecan.ca -L 5905:rc12509:5901
Duo two-factor login for username
Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
rc12509(compute node):~ $
```

For Nibi, a new form of the tunnel command `ssh -J username@clustername -L localforwardedport:localhost:remotelisteningport computenode` must be used. In addition, an SSH key pair must be created on your laptop with the contents of the pub key entered into your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on `nibi`. This approach will also work on any other cluster and so may eventually be preferred. Continuing with the above example, where `c48` is the compute node that you started your VNC server on, and 5905 is the local port on your laptop being forwarded, the tunnel command would be:

```bash
laptop:~ $ ssh -J username@nibi.alliancecan.ca -L 5905:localhost:5901 c48
Duo two-factor login for username
Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
c48(compute node):~ $
```

If you exit the node that your tunnel is connected to, you will no longer be able to connect to the VNC server with `vncviewer`. However, since your VNC server will continue running, you may regain access to it by simply starting a new tunnel. For more information about tunnels, see [SSH tunnel](../getting-started/ssh_tunnelling.md).

**3) Connect to the VNC server**

If you have a Linux desktop, open a new local terminal window and tell your VNC client to connect to `localhost:port`. The following example uses the TigerVNC `vncviewer` command to connect to the running VNC server on cdr768. You will be prompted for the VNC password that you set up earlier in order to connect.

```bash
laptop:~ $ vncviewer localhost:5905
TigerVNC viewer v1.15.0

```

If you are on a Mac or Windows desktop (not a Linux distro), then instead of running the `vncviewer` from the command line, you may click the *TigerVNC Viewer* application icon and enter your `localhost:port` information. As a side note, the default VNC port assumed by *TigerVNC Viewer* is 5900, therefore if you specified 5900 as the local port to be forwarded when you started your SSH tunnel, then you could simply specify `localhost`. Windows users however may find they cannot set up an SSH tunnel on local port 5900 in the first place.

Once `vncviewer` connects, you will be presented with a [Linux MATE desktop](https://mate-desktop.org/). To launch a terminal, click on the top menu on "Applications -> System Tools -> MATE Terminal". You may also add a shortcut to the top menu by right-clicking on "MATE Terminal" and by clicking on "Add this launcher to panel". Finally, to launch a program, invoke the command as you would normally within a `bash` session, for example `xclock`. To start a more complicated program like MATLAB, load the module and then run the `matlab` command.

## More Information

### VNC Server Password

To reset your VNC server password, use the `vncpasswd` command:

```bash
gra-login1:~ $ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
```

Optionally, you can completely remove your VNC configuration (including your password) by deleting your `~/.vnc` directory. The next time you run `vncserver`, you will be prompted to set a new password.

### Killing VNC Server

If a running VNC server is no longer needed, terminate it with `vncserver -kill :DISPLAY#` for example:

```bash
gra-login1:~ $ vncserver -list | grep -v ^$
TurboVNC sessions:
X DISPLAY #	PROCESS ID	NOVNC PROCESS ID
:44	        27644
gra-login1:~ $ vncserver -kill :44
Killing Xvnc process ID 27644
```

If you have multiple VNC servers running on a node, you may kill them ALL instantly by running:

```bash
gra-login1:~ $ pkill Xvnc -u $USER
```

### Multiple Connections

All VNC server(s) running under your username (on a login or compute node) can be displayed with `vncserver -list`. If a VNC server was started with the additional `-AlwaysShared` option then multiple connections to it can be made by establishing a new tunnel and `vncviewer` from any remote location. For example:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ vncserver -idletimeout 86400 -alwaysshared | grep -v ^$
Desktop 'TurboVNC: l4.nibi.sharcnet:1 (yourusername)' started on display l4.nibi.sharcnet:1
Starting applications specified in /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2023/x86-64-v3/usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc
Log file is /home/yourusername/.vnc/l4.nibi.sharcnet:1.log
```

Thus, one could start a VNC server running while at the office and then go home, establish new tunnels to the login or compute node where the VNC server is still running, and reconnect again with `vncviewer` to access the same desktop and seamlessly continue working. If however your VNC server was not started with `vncserver -AlwaysShared`, then only one `vncviewer` connection will be possible and you would need to close down all applications running in the desktop then shut down your VNC server, all before going home. Then later once home, you would need to restart a whole new desktop from scratch and all applications just to finally continue working.

### Failures to Connect

Repeated failing attempts to establish a new VNC server/viewer connection may be due to an old SSH tunnel still running on your desktop tying up ports. To identify and kill any such tunnels, open a terminal window on your desktop and run `ps ux | grep ssh` followed by `kill PID`.

### Unlock Screensaver

If your VNC screensaver times out and requests a password, enter your cluster account password to unlock it (not your VNC server password). If you are running the MATE desktop and the screensaver will not unlock, try running `killall -9 .mate-screensaver`. This should no longer be a problem on our clusters as the VNC screensaver has been disabled.

### Cannot Log In

The procedure to log in to `gra-vdi.alliancecan.ca` is a two-step process:

1)
`username`
`Enter your (ccdb) password`
2)
`username`
`Enter your Duo two-factor MFA passcode`

If you enter the wrong username/password for 1), you will still be prompted by 2). If you then send your username/passcode, then you will receive a message that says **Success, Logging you in...** and be returned to the log in screen of 1). The solution is to try again being sure to enter your correct username/password combination. If you cannot recall your CCDB password, visit [here](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/security/forgot) to reset it, assuming your account is not pending renewal by your PI.

### OpenGL Graphics

To run a graphics-based program that uses hardware-based accelerated OpenGL, a couple of changes will be required in the above *Compute Nodes* section.

First, the `salloc` command must be modified to request a GPU node. If this is not done, the program will fall back to using software-based rendering on CPUs, which is relatively much slower. To request the first GPU node that becomes available (and in turn minimize your queue wait time if the cluster has multiple GPU node types) simply specify:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname
```

If however the cluster you are using has multiple node types, where one is known to provide good graphics acceleration such as a node with a **t4** GPU, then specify:

```bash
l4(login node):~ $ salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=t4:1 --mem=16000 --account=def-piname
```

Second, `vglrun` will probably need to be added just before the name of your `PROGRAM` on the command line of your VNC desktop terminal window. For example:

```bash
c48(compute node):~ $ vglrun -d egl PROGRAM
```

Then `vglrun` sets some extra environment variables to ensure your program will use correct VirtualGL libraries. If however your `PROGRAM` has already been patched to use the current CVFMS standard environment, doing so will not be required.

### Portal Alternatives

If you experience graphics issues when using VNC as described above, try instead using [OpenOnDemand](https://ondemand.sharcnet.ca/) on the Nibi cluster or [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.rorqual.alliancecan.ca) on the **Rorqual** cluster. Both systems offer an automated modern desktop VDI web interface GUI experience that is designed for ease of use with improved hardware performance and software support.
