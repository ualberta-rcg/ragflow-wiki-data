## What are the differences between `StdEnv/2023` and the earlier environments?
The differences are discussed in [Standard software environments](../programming/standard_software_environments.md).

## Can I change my default standard environment?
After 2024 April 1, **`StdEnv/2023` will be the default environment for all clusters.** However, you can specify your own default environment at any time by modifying the `$HOME/.modulerc` file. For example, running the following command will set your default environment to `StdEnv/2020`:

```bash
echo "module-version StdEnv/2020 default" >> $HOME/.modulerc
```

You must log out and log in again for this change to take effect.

## Do I need to reinstall/recompile my code when the `StdEnv` changes?
Yes. If you compile your own code, or have installed R or Python packages, you should recompile your code or reinstall the packages you need with the newest version of the standard environment.

## How can I use an earlier environment?
If you have an existing workflow and want to continue to use the same software versions you are using now, simply add

```bash
module load StdEnv/2020
```

to your job scripts before loading any other modules.

## Will the earlier environments be removed?
!!! warning "Unsupported Environments"
    The earlier environments and any software dependent on them will remain available, **but versions 2016.4 and 2018.3 are no longer supported**, and we recommend not using them. Our staff will only install software in the new environment 2023.

## Can I mix modules from different environments?
!!! warning
    No, you should use a single environment for a given job. Different jobs can use different standard environments by explicitly loading one or the other at the job's beginning, but within a single job you should only use a single environment. The results of trying to mix different environments are unpredictable and will generally lead to errors.

## Which environment should I use?
!!! tip
    If you are starting a new project, or if you want to use a newer version of an application, you should use `StdEnv/2023` by adding

    ```bash
    module load StdEnv/2023
    ```

    to your job scripts. This command does not need to be deleted to use `StdEnv/2023` after April 1.

## Can I keep using an older environment by loading modules in my `.bashrc`?
!!! warning "Do Not Load Modules in .bashrc"
    Loading modules in your `.bashrc` is **not recommended**. Instead, explicitly load modules in your job scripts.

## I don't use the HPC clusters but cloud resources only. Do I need to worry about this?
No, this change will only affect the [Available software](../programming/available_software.md) accessed by [using environment modules](using-modules.md).

## I can no longer load a module that I previously used
!!! note
    More recent versions of most applications are installed in the new environment. To see the available versions, run the `module avail` command. For example,

    ```bash
    module avail gcc
    ```

    shows several versions of the GCC compilers, which may be different from those in earlier environments.
