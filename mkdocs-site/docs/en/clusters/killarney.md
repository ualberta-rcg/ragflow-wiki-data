**Killarney** is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. **Killarney** is located at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and is managed by the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [SciNet](https://www.scinethpc.ca/). It is named after the [Killarney Ontario Provincial Park](https://www.ontarioparks.ca/park/killarney), located near Georgian Bay.

This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

## Site-specific policies
Killarney is currently open to Vector affiliated PIs with CCAI Chairs as well as researchers within an AI program at a Canadian university or applying AI methods for their research.

## Access
To access Killarney, each researcher must [request access in the CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services).

Principal Investigators must be granted an AIP-type RAP (prefix `aip-`) by their AI Institution, or by applying for [General Access to PAICE Systems](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/paice/general_access_to_paice_systems).

For the PI to sponsor researchers in their AIP RAP, the PI must:
* Go to the "Resource Allocation Projects" table on the CCDB Home page.
* Locate the RAPI of your AIP project (with the `aip-` prefix) and click on it to reach the RAP management page.
* At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on "Manage RAP memberships."
* Enter the CCRI of the user you want to add in the "Add Members" section.

!!! warning
    To ensure the integrity and security of this resource, Vector enforces geo-blocking on Killarney as one of its cyber-security controls. Vector restricts access to and from countries identified in the [Government of Canada's Cyber Threat Assessment](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/national-cyber-threat-assessment-2025-2026).

## Killarney hardware specifications

| Performance Tier | Nodes | Model | CPU | Cores | System Memory | GPUs per node | Total GPUs |
|:-----------------|:------|:------|:----|:------|:--------------|:--------------|:-----------|
| Standard Compute | 168   | Dell 750xa | 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6338 | 64 | 512 GB | 4 x NVIDIA L40S 48GB | 672 |
| Performance Compute | 10 | Dell XE9680 | 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6442Y | 48 | 2048 GB | 8 x NVIDIA H100 SXM 80GB | 80 |

## Storage system

**Killarney**'s storage system is an all-NVME VastData platform with a total usable capacity of 1.7PB.

### Home space
* Location of /home directories.
* Each /home directory has a small fixed [quota](../storage-and-data/storage_and_file_management.md#filesystem-quotas-and-policies).
* Larger requests go to the /project space.
* Has daily backup

### Scratch space
* For active or temporary (scratch) storage.
* Large fixed [quota](../storage-and-data/storage_and_file_management.md#filesystem-quotas-and-policies) per user.
* Inactive data will be [purged](../storage-and-data/scratch_purging_policy.md).

### Project space
* Large adjustable [quota](../storage-and-data/storage_and_file_management.md#filesystem-quotas-and-policies) per project.
* Has daily backup.

## Network interconnects

Standard Compute nodes are interconnected with Infiniband HDR100 for 100Gbps throughput, while Performance Compute nodes are connected with 2 x HDR 200 for 400Gbps aggregate throughput.

## Scheduling
The **Killarney** cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

## Software
* Module-based software stack.
* Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
