*Parent page: [Cloud](cloud.md)*

On the [cloud](cloud.md), you are responsible for the security of your virtual machines.

This document is not a complete guide, but will set out some things you need to consider when creating a VM on the cloud.

## Basic security talk recording
There is a recording of an ~1.5 hr talk on some basic security considerations when working with VMs in the cloud available on YouTube called [Safety First!](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs).

Below is a list of links to different sections of the recording for easier video navigation.
* [Talk overview](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=219)
* [Cloud service levels](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=354)
* [General security principles](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=563)
* [Key topics](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=789)
* [Creating a first VM (with some comments about security)](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=817)
* [OpenStack security groups](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=1530)
* [SSH Security](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=1964)
* [Logs](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=3281)
* [Creating backups of VMs](https://youtu.be/l3CcXzaVpTs?t=4180)

## Keep the operating system secured
* Apply security updates on a regular basis (see [updating your VM](#updating-your-vm)).
* Avoid using packages from unknown sources.
* Use a recent image; for example, don't use Ubuntu 14.04 when Ubuntu 18.04 is available.
* Use [SSH key](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/SSH_Keys) authentication instead of passwords. Cloud instances use SSH key authentication by default, and enabling password-based authentication is significantly less secure.
* Install [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org) to block [brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack).

## Network security
* Limit who can access your service. Avoid using **0.0.0.0** in the CIDR field of the security group form - in particular, don't create rules for `0.0.0.0` in the default security group, which applies automatically to all project instances.
  * Be aware of the range you are opening with the netmask you are configuring.
* Do not bundle ranges of ports to allow access.
* Think carefully about your security rules. Consider the following:
  * These services aren't meant to be publicly accessible:
    * ssh (22) - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
    * RDP (3389) - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
    * mysql (3306)
    * VNC (5900-5906) - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
    * postgresql (5432)
    * nosql
    * tomcat
    * ... many, many others
  * Some services are meant to be accessible from the internet:
    * Apache (80, 443)
    * Nginx (80, 443)
    * ... others
* Configure your web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
  * In many case HTTP should only be used to redirect traffic to HTTPS.
* Do NOT run a mail server.
* Do NOT run a BitTorrent server.

## Updating your VM
In order to keep a VM's operating system secure, it must be regularly updated - ideally weekly, or as often as new packages become available. To upgrade a Linux VM choose the commands below for your particular distribution. Note you will need to reconnect to your VM after rebooting.
### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
### CentOS
```bash
sudo yum update
sudo reboot
```
### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo reboot
```
