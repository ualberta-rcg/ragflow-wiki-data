# Cloud Technical Glossary

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| **Apache HTTP Server** | A Web server software. See [Apache HTTP Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server). |
| **CALM** (cloud account lifecycle management) | Our process for managing the allocation of cloud resources. |
| **Ceph** | The distributed data storage platform for our clouds; includes volume storage. |
| **[CephFS](cephfs.md)** (Ceph File System) | A filesystem with Ceph storage, which allows data to be mounted simultaneously on multiple OpenStack instances. Currently only available with Arbutus. See [https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/). |
| **cloud** | When referring to our cloud services, short form of *IaaS cloud*. |
| **compute cloud** | Type of resource allocated to support OpenStack instances intended to run for a limited time, usually with a very high sustained usage of CPU and memory. Flavours for these resources have labels beginning with c\*. Currently only available on Arbutus, Béluga and Cedar. Compare with *persistent cloud*. |
| **[CVMFS](../software/cvmfs/cvmfs.md)** (CernVM File System) | A read-only content distribution system often used to manage software. |
| **ephemeral local disk** | Virtual disk which is created and destroyed along with an OpenStack instance. An ephemeral disk is created when an instance is launched without the specification of a volume. |
| **flavor** | OpenStack term for a predefined specification of a new instance. A flavor can define sizes for RAM, disk, number of cores, and so on. |
| **floating IP** | Internet Protocol address that can be associated with an OpenStack instance to allow external access. |
| **Horizon** | OpenStack cloud dashboard that is used for viewing and managing cloud resources through a Web browser. See [https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/). |
| **host** | Physical server supporting virtual machines. |
| **[image](working_with_images.md)** | Image of a virtual disk used to create a new boot volume or ephemeral disk when creating an OpenStack instance. |
| **instance** | OpenStack virtual machines are called *instances*, mostly because they are instances of an image that is created upon request and that is configured when the instance is launched. |
| **[IPV6](using_ipv6_in_cloud.md)** (Internet Protocol version 6) | A communications protocol successor to IPv4. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6). |
| **[object storage](arbutus_object_storage.md)** | Object storage (or *object-based storage*) is a storage type that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like filesystems which manage data as a file hierarchy, and storage types where data is managed as blocks. Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier. Offered as S3 and Swift protocols. Allocated in TB. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage). Currently only available with Arbutus. |
| **[OpenStack](managing_your_cloud_resources_with_openstack.md)** | The software suite used on our clouds to control hardware resources such as computers, storage and networking. |
| **persistent cloud** | Allocation type for persistent virtual machines that are expected to run indefinitely and have low or bursty CPU requirements. Flavours for these resources have labels beginning with p\*. Currently only available on Arbutus, Béluga and Cedar. Compare with *compute cloud*. |
| **project** | In our infrastructure, a project represents an allocation of cloud resources to a group or user. Sometimes referred to as *tenant*. |
| **[RAC](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/research-portal/accessing-resources/resource-allocation-competitions)** (Resource Allocation Competition) | Our program via which PIs can submit a request for storage and computer resources beyond what can be obtained via the Rapid Access Service (RAS). The requests are evaluated by a committee of peers. |
| **[RAS](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/research-portal/accessing-resources/rapid-access-service)** (Rapid Access Service) | Service by which Principal Investigators can request a modest amount of storage and cloud resources without having to apply to the RAC. |
| **S3** (Simple Storage Service) | A type of object storage. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3). |
| **[security group](managing_your_cloud_resources_with_openstack.md#security_groups)** | A set of security rules that control network traffic and can be applied as a whole to one or more instances. |
| **service portal** | Our infrastructure hosts many Web research portals which serve datasets or tools to a broad research community. These portals generally do not require large computing or storage resources, but may require support efforts from our technical team. Groups applying for a service portal often use our clouds, generally require a public IP address, and may have more stringent up-time requirements than most research projects. |
| **shared filesystem** | Persistent storage space offered as a Unix-compliant filesystem that can be mounted across multiple hosts in a project. This is useful for sharing data across multiple hosts. Our service runs on CephFS and requires either a Fuse driver (Windows/Linux) or the CephFS kernel driver (Linux) for access. Allocated in TB. |
| **snapshot** | Copy of an OpenStack volume that can be used as a backup or to launch another instance. |
| **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) | A protocol to allow encrypted communications over networks. SSL is obsolete and should be replaced by TLS (Transport Layer Security) wherever possible. |
| **SWIFT** | A type of object storage. See [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift). |
| **tenant** | See **project**. |
| **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) | See **SSL**. |
| **vCPU** (virtual central processing unit) | A vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular virtual machine. |
| **[vGPU](using_cloud_vgpus.md)** (virtual graphics processing unit) | A virtual machine can have one or more vGPUs assigned to it. Each of them is seen as a GPU by the operating system. Additional configuration may be required for use. |
| **virtual machine** | Virtual server in the cloud infrastructure. In OpenStack, active virtual machines are called *instances*. |
| **[volume](working_with_volumes.md)** | Storage resource that can be attached to or detached from an OpenStack instance, like a virtual disk. |
| **volume storage** | Type of persistent cloud storage providing virtual disk functionality to OpenStack instances running in the cloud. Implemented with Ceph software. Allocated in GB. |
